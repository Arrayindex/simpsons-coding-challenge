# Coding Challenge!

Create a java web application that uses the json documents in our data folder here to allow users to search for and view information on our characters and display some of their quotes.

**Definition of Done**

_We need to see this_

1. A spring boot application that starts on port 8081
1. A rest api that serves up all of the characters, allows search of characters, and returns a specific character's quotes.
1. A JQuery based user interface to display the information served up by your api.
1. We would like to all CRUD operations supported in this api.
1. __Meaningful__ Junit Unit tests 

**What we're looking at**
1. A meaningful and logical rest api
1. A clean simple user interface
1. Well formatted javascript code
1. Clean gitflow workflow so we can see your thought process

**How to submit**

Fork this github repository and commit your submission in your fork, send us a link and we'll clone and review the code when it's submitted to us.

**Required Technologies:**

* Java 8
* Spring Boot 
* JUnit
* Mockito
* JQuery
* Bootstrap

**Optional Technologies**

* Docker
* Swagger

**Notes**

* We're not asking you to spin up a full database, an in memory datastore is good enough.
* Once we recieve your submission we'll look at the code from the time you email us your submission. (Production deployments are important and should be taken with care)
* Feel free to expand on this idea add functionality beyond the base ask, this is your opportunity to show off :)
